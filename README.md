Monitoring Isolated Individuals and Detecting Emergencies

## Objectives
The objective of this project is to develop an app that leverages phone activity to monitor and ensure the well-
being of users, particularly focusing on confirming their presence and status. The app will continuously analyze
the user’s phone activity and, in cases of prolonged inactivity, will alert selected contacts to check on the user’s
welfare. This proactive approach aims to provide reassurance to both users and their contacts, promoting a sense
of safety and connectedness. 

## Abstract
This project aims to create an innovative mobile application designed to enhance the safety and well-being of
individuals, particularly those who may be isolated or at risk. The app will utilize algorithms to analyze user
phone activity, focusing on confirming the user’s presence and status. In the event of prolonged inactivity, the
app will intelligently alert designated contacts, enabling them to reach out and ensure the user’s welfare. By
providing a proactive approach to monitoring, the app seeks to offer peace of mind to both users and their
contacts, fostering a greater sense of security and connectedness within communities. 

## Applications
1. Monitoring Elderly Relatives: The app can be used by individuals to monitor the activity of elderly relatives
living alone, providing reassurance and enabling timely assistance in case of emergencies.
2. Mental Health Support: The app can be used as a tool for mental health support, allowing users to share
their phone activity with a trusted contact who can provide support and intervention if necessary.
3. Medical Monitoring: The app can assist individuals with medical conditions that require regular monitor-
ing by alerting caregivers or healthcare providers if there are any deviations from normal phone activity
patterns.
These are just a few examples of how the app can be applied to enhance safety and well-being in various contexts

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the development of this app represents a significant step forward in leveraging technology for the
well-being and safety of individuals, particularly those who may be isolated or vulnerable. By utilizing phone
activity as a means of monitoring, the app offers a proactive approach to ensuring the welfare of users, enabling
timely intervention in case of emergencies or prolonged periods of inactivity. This innovative solution not only
provides reassurance to users but also promotes a greater sense of security and connectedness within communities.
